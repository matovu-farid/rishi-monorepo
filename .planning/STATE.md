## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: On-device embeddings primary, server fallback for bulk (react-native-executorch + all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- [Init]: Build on existing Expo scaffold at apps/mobile/ (Expo 54, NativeWind, New Architecture)
- [Init]: D1 + R2 sync backend with LWW conflict resolution, expo-sqlite + Drizzle on mobile
- [Init]: Desktop sync integration in scope as late phase (Phase 8) -- mobile standalone first
- [Phase 01]: Used Slot instead of Stack in root layout for route group navigation
- [Phase 01]: Custom sign-in UI with useSignIn/useOAuth hooks for NativeWind styling control

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Desktop sync scope: PROJECT.md originally listed desktop changes as out of scope, but bidirectional sync (Phase 8) requires desktop schema migration and sync engine. Decision needed before Phase 4 planning.
- No Expo Go: react-native-pdf and react-native-executorch require native modules. Development uses custom dev client only (set up in Phase 1).
- Embedding model delivery: ~80MB model download on first use needs graceful UX. Decision: download-on-first-use with progress indicator.
